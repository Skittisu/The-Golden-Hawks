# Advanced Data Tagging for Data Fitness and Quality
Our goal is to use advanced data tagging  with metadata  for data fitness and quality to reduce the manually-intensive work in data management life cycle. It will ensure the metadata accurately enables discovery, access and usage of the data for data fitness and quality. Furthermore, we will use  data analytics and AI/ML techniques to improve this situation.
# Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to better enable users to differentiate datasets that are more likely to meet their business needs. This helps users and organizations to save time and resources to refocus human efforts toward tuning parameters instead of data entry of metadata.
